# ADES XML Schema

The [Astrometry Data Exchange Standard](http://www.minorplanetcenter.net/mpec/K15/K15O06.html) defines a number of data fields.  These are described in the XML schema file `ades.xsd`.  The standard also gives an example of how data elements might be organized in an XML document.  The file `exchange.xsd` shows an organization for all elements of `ades.xsd`.  The example XML data document from standard is reproduced here as `exchange.xml`.  `submit.xsd` is more restrictive as an example of a schema that the MPC might use to validate submissions.
